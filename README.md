# Portfolio Demo Hub

This repository powers a simple, focused demo hub I use to showcase **shipped full-stack systems**, along with my learning journey over the past four years.

Each project is presented the way I’d want to evaluate someone else’s work:
- what it does (in plain English)
- what it proves technically
- where to click first to understand it quickly

## What you’ll see

The demo hub highlights four projects, each representing a different systems problem:

- **Authentication & Identity**
  - JWT authentication, refresh flows, reusable auth integration, and centralized identity
- **Real-time Multiplayer + Presence**
  - WebSockets, Redis, live state synchronization, chat, invites, and online/offline awareness
- **Healthcare Reporting System (Lumen)**
  - Domain-driven backend design, structured clinical data, and AI-assisted workflows
- **Shared Infrastructure**
  - Reusable logging, auth integration, and internal tooling built to support multiple services

Each card includes a short **“Try this”** path so you can evaluate the system without reading code first.

## Why this exists

Resumes and bullet points don’t do a great job showing:
- how systems are structured
- how real-time and async problems are handled
- how AI can be used responsibly inside production workflows

This hub is meant to bridge that gap.

## Tech stack

**Frontend**
- React + TypeScript (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS

**Backend / Systems**
- Django / DRF
- FastAPI
- Redis + WebSockets
- PostgreSQL / SQL
- LangChain / LangGraph for AI-assisted features

**Deployment**
- Netlify
